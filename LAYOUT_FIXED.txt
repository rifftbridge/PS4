# ✅ LAYOUT FIXED - All Controls Now Visible!

## 🐛 THE PROBLEM:

Text and controls below the Conversion Log were getting cut off:
- Output folder path was hidden
- "Change" button was hidden
- "Convert All" button was hidden
- Progress bar was hidden

You had to manually resize the window to see them!

---

## ✅ THE FIXES:

### Fix 1: Reduced Log Height ✅
**Before:**
```python
height=6  # Log was too tall
```

**After:**
```python
height=4  # Smaller log = more room for controls!
```

The log still has a scrollbar, so you can see everything - just more compact!

---

### Fix 2: Better Row Weights ✅
**Before:**
```python
left_panel.rowconfigure(2, weight=1)  # Only file list could resize
```

**After:**
```python
left_panel.rowconfigure(2, weight=1)  # File list can shrink
left_panel.rowconfigure(3, weight=1)  # Log can shrink
# Row 4 (controls) has NO weight = always visible!
```

Now the file list and log can shrink if needed, but controls at the bottom ALWAYS show!

---

### Fix 3: Increased Window Height ✅
**Before:**
```python
self.root.geometry("1600x700")  # 700px tall
```

**After:**
```python
self.root.geometry("1600x800")  # 800px tall - 100px more space!
```

More vertical space = everything fits comfortably!
