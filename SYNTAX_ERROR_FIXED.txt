# 🐛 SYNTAX ERROR FIXED! + Better Build Script

## ❌ THE PROBLEM:

**Syntax Error on Line 197:**
```python
self.log_message(...)
else:  # ← ORPHANED ELSE! No matching IF!
    placeholder = ...
```

This caused the build to fail completely!

---

## ✅ THE FIXES:

### Fix 1: Removed Orphaned `else:` Block ✅
The code had leftover lines from an old version that broke Python syntax.

**Removed lines 197-205:**
```python
else:
    # No artwork found - show placeholder
    placeholder = ttk.Label(...)
    ...
```

**Why it was wrong:**
The logic now uses `if not artwork_path: return` earlier, so the `else` had no matching `if` statement at that indentation level.

---

### Fix 2: Build Script Shows Errors Now ✅
**Before:**
```batch
rocksmith_gui.py 2>nul  ← Hid all errors!
```

**After:**
```batch
rocksmith_gui.py        ← Shows actual errors!
echo Build command completed with error level: %errorlevel%
```

Now you can see what went wrong!

---

### Fix 3: Better Artwork Detection ✅
**Before:**
```batch
if exist "..." (
    ...
) else if exist "..." (
    ...
) else (
    ...
)
```
This had issues with variable scope.

**After:**
```batch
set ARTWORK_FLAG=
if exist "..." (
    set "ARTWORK_FLAG=..."
    goto :artwork_done
)
if exist "..." (
    set "ARTWORK_FLAG=..."
    goto :artwork_done
)
echo ! Artwork not found
:artwork_done
```

Uses `goto` labels for cleaner logic!

### Fix 4: Better Error Messages ✅
The build script now tells you:
- Exact error level from PyInstaller
- Common issues and solutions
- Where to find build warnings
