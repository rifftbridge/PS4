Convert your PC Rocksmith DLC to PS4 DLC for Homebrew PS4.

I don't condone piracy. I built this with Clause ai to move the few purchases I had made on my old PS3 and on my Steam to a PS4 I picked up.

I just wanted to see if I could do it.

Don't ruin it for anyone by trying to monetise this or doing anything illegal.

The software is free to use and change. 

The image of the people rocking out is licensed only for this one use, so don't reuse that either; the rest I made from scratch (my day job)

As of 7 Jan 2026 its not actually working. I am just testing plugging clude code into github, yes im clueless, im a graphic designer not a coder
